# Fairway-Friends
A golf website to meet new people and play new courses. Golf has increased in popularity during the pandemic, but many people are still unsure as to whether joining a course represents value for money. This website would allow non-members to book guest tee-times alongside current members to experience the course at a cheaper rate, but also see first hand the type of clientele the course attracts. Both members and guests will have profiles that would allow them to be best matched based on handicaps and interests outside golf.
